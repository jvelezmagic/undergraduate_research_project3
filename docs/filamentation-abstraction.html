<p>Scientists have extensively studied the mechanisms that orchestrate the growth and division of bacterial cells.
Cells adapt their shape and dimensions in response to variations in the intracellular and extracellular environments by integrating information about the presence of nutrients or harmful agents in the decision to grow or divide.
Filamentation is a process that occurs when rod-shaped cells stop dividing but continue to grow, thus producing elongated cells.
Some cells can naturally grow as filamentous, while others only do so under stressful conditions [x, x].
Here we use mathematical modeling and computational simulations to evaluate a toxic agent’s intracellular concentration as a function of cell length.
We show that filamentation can act as a strategy that promotes the resilience of a bacterial population under stressful environmental conditions.</p>

</h2>
<p>By integrating information from the environment, cells can alter their cell cycle.
For instance, some cells arrest the cell division in the presence of toxic agents but continue to grow.
Previous studies have shown that this filamentation phenomenon provides a mechanism that enables cells to cope with stress, which leads to an increase in the probability of survival <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-justiceMorphologicalPlasticityBacterial2008" role="doc-biblioref">Sheryl S. Justice et al. 2008</a>)</span>.
For example, filamentation can be a process capable of subverting innate defenses during urinary tract infection, facilitating the transition of additional rounds of intracellular bacterial community formation <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-justiceFilamentationEscherichiaColi2006" role="doc-biblioref">S. S. Justice et al. 2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Although filament growth can help mitigate environmental stress (e.g., by activating the SOS response system <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-justiceMorphologicalPlasticityBacterial2008" role="doc-biblioref">Sheryl S. Justice et al. 2008</a>)</span>), the evolutionary benefits of producing elongated cells that do not divide are unclear.
Here, we proposed a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations that explicitly considers the concentration of intracellular toxin as a function of the cell’s length (see Equation <a href="filamentation-abstraction.html#eq:model-equation">(2.1)</a>).
The model is built based on the growth ratio of measurements of the surface area (<span class="math inline">\(SA\)</span>) and the cell volume (<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>), whereby the uptake rate of the toxin depends on the <span class="math inline">\(SA\)</span>.
However, <span class="math inline">\(V's\)</span> rate of change for <span class="math inline">\(SA\)</span> is higher than <span class="math inline">\(SA\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, which results in a transient reduction in the intracellular toxin concentration (see Figure <a href="filamentation-abstraction.html#fig:cell-dimensions-relationship">2.1</a>).
Therefore, we hypothesized that this geometric interpretation of filamentation represents a biophysical defense line to increase the probability of a bacterial population’s survival in response to stressful environments.</p>

</h2>
<p>Let us assume the shape of cells is a cylinder with hemispherical ends.
Based on this geometric structure, a nonlinear system of differential equations governing filamentation can be written as follows:</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:model-equation">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{dT_{int}}{dt} &amp;= T_{sa} \cdot (T_{ext}(t) - T_{vol}) - \alpha \cdot T_{ant} \cdot T_{int} \\
\frac{dL}{dt} &amp;= 
  \begin{cases} 
    \beta \cdot L,&amp; \text{if } T_{int} \geq T_{sos},  t \geq \tau_{sos} + \tau_{delay} \text{ and } L &lt; L_{max}  \\
    0,            &amp; \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{split}
\tag{2.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>It considers the internal toxin (<span class="math inline">\(T_{int}\)</span>) and the cell length (<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>) as variables.
<span class="math inline">\(T_{sa}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{vol}\)</span> represent the surface area and volume of the toxin in the cell, respectively.
<span class="math inline">\(T_{ext}(t)\)</span> is a function that returns the amount of toxin in the cell medium.
<span class="math inline">\(T_{anti}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> symbolize the amount of antitoxin and its efficiency rate, respectively.
<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> as the rate of filamentation.
<span class="math inline">\(L_{max}\)</span> is the maximum size that the cell can reach when filamentation is on.
<span class="math inline">\(T_{sos}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_{kill}\)</span> are thresholds for filamentation and death, respectively.
Finally, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{delay}\)</span> is the amount of time required to activate filamentation after reaching the <span class="math inline">\(T_{sos}\)</span> threshold.</p>

<p>When growing rod-shaped bacterial cells under constant conditions, the distribution of lengths and radii is narrow <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-schaechterGrowthCellNuclear1962" role="doc-biblioref">Schaechter et al. 1962</a>)</span>.
However, when growing under stress conditions, some cells produce filaments <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-schaechterDependencyMediumTemperature1958" role="doc-biblioref">Schaechter, MaalOe, and Kjeldgaard 1958</a>)</span>.
This phenomenon may depend on the SOS response system <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-bosEmergenceAntibioticResistance2015" role="doc-biblioref">Bos et al. 2015</a>)</span>, which can repair DNA damage, giving the cell greater chances of recovering and surviving under stress conditions.
Besides, the SOS response has been reported to have precise temporal coordination in individual bacteria <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-friedmanPreciseTemporalModulation2005" role="doc-biblioref">Friedman et al. 2005</a>)</span>.
Among the stress conditions that can trigger the SOS response is exposure to beta-lactam antibiotics <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-millerSOSResponseInduction2004" role="doc-biblioref">Miller 2004</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In general, filamentation has been studied as an unavoidable consequence of stress.
However, we considered filamentation an active process that produces the first line of defense against toxic agents.
Therefore, a differential equation model was proposed that assesses the change in the amount of internal toxin as a function of cell length.
At the core of this model, we include the intrinsic relationship between the surface area and the capsule volume since it is vital in determining cell size <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-harrisRelativeRatesSurface2016" role="doc-biblioref">Harris and Theriot 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In figure <a href="filamentation-abstraction.html#fig:filamentation-model-ramp-signal">2.2</a>, cells grow in a ramp-shaped external toxin signal without considering a toxin-antitoxin system.
As time progresses, the toxin in the external environment increases, so the cell raises its internal toxin levels.
At approximately time <span class="math inline">\(22\)</span>, any cell reaches <span class="math inline">\(T_{sos}\)</span>.
The control cell (unable to filament) and the average cell (capable of filamenting) reach the death threshold, <span class="math inline">\(T_{kill}\)</span>, at times <span class="math inline">\(31\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(93\)</span> (hatched and solid black lines), respectively.
Therefore, under this example, the cell has increased its life span three times more than in control by growing as a filament (green shaded area versus orange shaded area).
In turn, figure <a href="filamentation-abstraction.html#fig:filamentation-model-ramp-signal">2.2</a> also shows stochastic simulations of the system in the intake of internal toxins.
Considering that cell growth and death processes are inherently stochastic, stochastic simulations would be a better approximation.
However, from now on, we will continue with the study of the deterministic model.</p>

<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) can be considered one of the most critical health problems of the century.
That is, microorganisms’ ability to grow despite exposure to substances designed to inhibit their growth or kill them.
In April 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its first global report on AMR surveillance <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-EditorialBoard2014" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Editorial <span>Board</span>”</span> 2014</a>)</span>.
Taking out of the darkness a common fear, a possible post-antibiotic future in which common infections or minor injuries can kill.
Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of avoiding antibiotic action is essential for producing knowledge and developing strategies that reduce the generation of resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>In other to characterize the degree of resistance, dose-response experiments determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-andrewsDeterminationMinimumInhibitory2002" role="doc-biblioref">Andrews 2002</a>)</span>. Bacteria are capable of modifying their MIC through various mechanisms, for example, mutations <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-lambertBacterialResistanceAntibiotics2005" role="doc-biblioref">Lambert 2005</a>)</span>, impaired membrane permeability <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-satoOuterMembranePermeability1991" role="doc-biblioref">Sato and Nakae 1991</a>)</span>, flux pumps <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-webberImportanceEffluxPumps2003" role="doc-biblioref">Webber 2003</a>)</span>, toxin-inactivating enzymes <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-wrightBacterialResistanceAntibiotics2005" role="doc-biblioref">Wright 2005</a>)</span>, and plasticity phenotypic <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-justiceMorphologicalPlasticityBacterial2008" role="doc-biblioref">Sheryl S. Justice et al. 2008</a>)</span>.
The latter is our phenomenon of interest because it considers the change in shape and size, allowing us to study it as a strategy to promote bacterial survival.</p>
<p>We decided to analyze the MIC change caused by filamentation through stable exposure experiments of different toxin amounts at other exposure times.
Computational simulations show that when comparing cells unable to filament with those that can, there is an increase in the capacity to tolerate more generous amounts of toxin, increasing their MIC (see Figure <a href="filamentation-abstraction.html#fig:increased-time-resistance">2.3</a>).
Therefore, it confers a gradual increase in resistance beyond filamentation’s role in improving the cell’s life span as the exposure time is longer.</p>

<p>One of the SOS response system properties is that it presents synchronous activation times within homogeneous populations <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-friedmanPreciseTemporalModulation2005" role="doc-biblioref">Friedman et al. 2005</a>)</span>.
It has constant gene expression rates that help it cope with stress; however, it is possible to introduce variability by considering having multicopy resistance plasmids <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-million-weaverMechanismsPlasmidSegregation2014" role="doc-biblioref">Million-Weaver and Camps 2014</a>)</span>.
Therefore, the response times would have an asynchronous behavior at the global level but synchronous at the local level.</p>
<p>To include this observation into the model, we include a negative term to the internal toxin representing a toxin-antitoxin system.
Therefore, the model now has an efficiency rate of the antitoxin and a stable amount per cell.
We simulate the effect of the toxin-antitoxin system variation within a <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span>-cell population; we initialize each one with similar initial conditions, except for the amount of internal antitoxin, defined as <span class="math inline">\(T_{anti} \sim N(\mu, \sigma)\)</span>.
Considering that <span class="math inline">\(T_{anti}\)</span> values <span class="math inline">\(&lt; 0\)</span> are equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.
For each experiment, <span class="math inline">\(\mu = 25\)</span>, while it was evaluated in the range <span class="math inline">\([0-20]\)</span>.
For the generation of pseudo-random numbers and to ensure the results’ reproducibility, the number <span class="math inline">\(42\)</span> was considered seed.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure <a href="filamentation-abstraction.html#fig:variability-toxin-antitoxin">2.4</a>, when we compare heterogeneous populations in their toxin-antitoxin system, we can achieve different population dynamics, that is, changes in the final proportions of cell states; normal, stressed, and dead.
This difference is because the cell sometimes has more or less antitoxin to handle the incoming stress situation.</p>

<p>Considering that the toxin-antitoxin system’s variability can modify the proportions of final cell states, a question arose about heterogeneity levels’ global behavior.
To answer this question, we evaluate the probability of survival for each population, defined by its distribution of antitoxin levels.
In this way, we characterized the population survival probability function into three essential points according to its effect: negative, invariant, and positive (see Figure <a href="filamentation-abstraction.html#fig:survival-probability">2.5</a>).
Furthermore, these points are relative to the homogeneous population’s death time in question (<span class="math inline">\(\tau_{kill}\)</span>): when <span class="math inline">\(t &lt; \tau_{kill}\)</span> will represent a detrimental effect on survival, <span class="math inline">\(t = \tau_{kill}\)</span> will be independent of variability, and <span class="math inline">\(t &gt; \tau_{kill}\)</span> will be a beneficial point for survival.
Therefore, we concluded that the effect of heterogeneity in a toxin-antitoxin system represents a double-edged sword.</p>

Finally, when <span class="math inline">\(t &gt; \tau_{kill}\)</span>, the heterogeneity of the population favors survival.

<p>Today, there have been advancements in the number of techniques that have allowed it to extend quantitative analyses to individual cells’ dynamic observations <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-camposConstantSizeExtension2014" role="doc-biblioref">Campos et al. 2014</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-meldrumFacultyOpinionsRecommendation2005" role="doc-biblioref">Meldrum 2005</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-sliusarenkoHighthroughputSubpixelPrecision2011" role="doc-biblioref">Sliusarenko et al. 2011</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-taheri-araghiCellSizeControlHomeostasis2017" role="doc-biblioref">Taheri-Araghi et al. 2017</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-ursellRapidPreciseQuantification2017" role="doc-biblioref">Ursell et al. 2017</a>)</span>.
Therefore, studying their cellular behavior every day from medium to medium can be somewhat reproducible, facilitating the association of complex biological functions in simple mathematical equations <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-neidhardtBacterialGrowthConstant1999" role="doc-biblioref">Neidhardt 1999</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Here, we proposed a mathematical model showing that filamentation could serve as a population’s resilience mechanism to stress conditions.
Finding that filamentation’s net effect generates an additional window of time for the cell to survive, decreasing the toxin’s intracellular concentration.
However, we also found that a side effect of filamentation is to increase the cell’s minimum inhibitory concentration.
On the other hand, when we introduce variability in the amount of antitoxin in a cell population, we found that heterogeneity can be a double-edged sword, sometimes detrimental and sometimes beneficial, depending on the time of exposure to the toxic agent.</p>
<p>Due to the above, despite being simple, the model could have the ability to recapitulate the behavior seen in nature from variables that we can calculate easily with single-cell measurements.
However, in other situations, it could be helpful to consider the addition of variables such as cell wall production and peptidoglycans’ accumulation, among others.
Notwithstanding the lack of parameters that are a little closer to reality, confirming that the model can work under experimental conditions would represent an achievement due to its explanatory simplicity, starting, in this way, the path of the study of filamentation oriented to the ecology of stress.</p>
