<p>The raw data processing consisted mainly of creating two levels of observation for the cells of both chromosomal strains and multicopy plasmids.
The first level is at a cell granularity, that is, point properties.
The second level consists of the cells over time, thus observing properties at the population level.
We did this because it would allow us to understand what factors are affecting filamentation and why.</p>
<p>We decided to normalize the fluorescence values of DS-Red and GFP for both experiments based on the values observed before the beginning of the exposure to antibiotics.
It allowed us to have a basis to work with and compare the expressions between cells.
In the case of DS-Red, we also applied a logarithmic transformation to observe subtle changes that would allow us to dig deeper.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we decided to classify cells into four fundamental groups based on whether the cell was filamented and survived (see <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-cells-distribution-across-experiments">1.1</a>).
We define a <em>filamented cell</em> as a cell with more than two standard deviations from the mean concerning the lengths observed before antibiotic entry into the system [].
On the other hand, although there are multiple ways to define death in a cell context [], we decided to consider a <em>cell dead or missing</em> when we stopped having information about it, either because of its fluorescence levels or because it left the field of experimental tracking.
Therefore, a <em>surviving cell</em> is one that existed before and after exposure to the antibiotic.</p>

</h3>
<p>From the complete set of tracking data, we decided to sum the tracking of each cell at the level of its tracking identifier.
The points to be evaluated represented the DS-Red, GFP, and length values at different time instants: initial, filamentation, and end.
This preprocessing allowed us to observe and quantify each cell at critical times in the experiment and eliminate noise or signals outside the scope of this investigation.</p>
<p>We defined the <em>initial time</em> as the first time we observed the cell in the experiment.
<em>Filamentation time</em> equals when a cell reaches the filamentation threshold (see Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-temporal-metric-distribution-length-1">1.4</a>) for the first time.
We defined the <em>end time</em> as the last observation of the cell.
We decided to bound the end time for surviving cells to one frame (10 min) after the end of antibiotic exposure so that the observed signal would reflect the final stress responses.</p>
<p>When we compared the distributions of the study variables (<em>i.e.</em>, DS-Red, GFP, and length) for both experiments, we observed small subtleties of filamentation in its role for cell survival.
In Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-temporal-metric-distribution-ds-red-1">1.2</a>, we show that indistinctly and as expected, surviving cells managed to eliminate the antibiotic by the end time, while dead cells presented higher levels of antibiotics.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the GFP observations in Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-temporal-metric-distribution-gfp-1">1.3</a> showed us two essential things for cell sorting.
1) The chromosomal strain did not exhibit noticeable changes in GFP levels as expected, and 2) that the filamented cells were those that had the lowest amount of plasmids at the beginning of the experiment.
On the other hand, for the final observation times, GFP measurements indicated that among the cells that did not filament, the surviving ones reduced their GFP expression slightly more concerning the dead ones and the initial times.
Meanwhile, for the filamented cells, whether surviving or dead, their GFP measurements indicated no difference at the beginning or the end of the experiment, indicating the presence of other determinants of cell survival.</p>

</div>
<p>Cell length was one of the factors that GFP expression levels could not explain for cell survival.
In Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-temporal-metric-distribution-length-1">1.4</a>, we show that the conclusions regarding filamentation were applicable for both chromosomal or plasmid strains.
For the initial times, filamented and survived cells were shorter in length than those that died but longer than not filamented cells of both classes, while non-filamented cells did not differ from each other.
We observed no length differences between cells at filamentation time.
Thus, survival could depend on other factors such as growth rate.
At the final time, the results were precise.
Surviving cells had a greater length relative to their non-surviving pair (<em>i.e.</em>, dead filamented and non-filamented cells).
However, for filamented cells, surviving cells represent a distribution of higher final length values in general but not as extensive as their dead counterpart.
Which we could explain as a length limit to which cells can grow without dying.
Nevertheless, we had no information to evaluate such a hypothesis.</p>

At the time of filamentation, there is no difference to help determine whether the cell will survive or not.

However, this length is moderate compared to the excess length shown by non-surviving filamented cells. On the other hand, we highlighted the growth of the surviving non-filamented cells. Therefore, although they did not reach a length for us to classify as filamented, the cells did resort to filamentation." width="100%"><p class="caption">

<p>Once we observed the effects of GFP expression levels and lengths in determining whether a cell lives or dies, we decided to project the cells onto the plane and paint them with their class color to determine whether these two variables contained the necessary information to cluster the data correctly.
In Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-focus-just-in-initial-values-1">1.5</a>, we show the initial GFP and length values projection.
While, with some work, we could contextually place the results in Figures <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-temporal-metric-distribution-gfp-1">1.3</a> and <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-temporal-metric-distribution-length-1">1.4</a>, the initial values did not appear to determine the classes.
Therefore, we explored the final versus initial values differences in Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-metric-differences-1">1.6</a>.
With this new representation of the cells in the plane, we contextualized the statistical results presented in Figures <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-temporal-metric-distribution-gfp-1">1.3</a> and <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-temporal-metric-distribution-length-1">1.4</a>.
Besides, it showed us that differences in length (<em>i.e.</em>, filamentation) and reductions in GFP expression are essential in determining cell survival.
Though, cell sorting is not entirely separate, which means that other variables are affecting the experimental results in cell survival.</p>

<!-- (ref:03-cells-life-time-classes-distribution-1-cap) **Cells life time classes distribution.** Chromosomal cells appear to show more remarkable survival by the filamented class compared to non-filamented survivors. On the other hand, in cells with plasmids, the relationship seems to be the opposite. However, this may be due to several factors. For instance, the levels of antibiotic resistance inherent in a heterogeneous population are the most simple explanation. For each cell, we calculate its lifetime, that is, the last time we saw the cell minus the time we had our first observation of it. After finishing the antibiotic exposure, we truncated the time to one frame (*i.e.*, $10$ minutes). From the first appearance of green or purple color (*i.e.*, surviving cells), higher lifetime values represent cells that existed long before the start of the experiment. -->

<p>In the <a href="experiment-analysis.html#cell-length-and-the-amount-of-gfp-are-crucial-in-determining-cell-survival">1.3.1</a> section, we explored how GFP variability and length help in determining cell survival.
However, Figures <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-focus-just-in-initial-values-1">1.5</a> and <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-metric-differences-1">1.6</a> showed us the possibility of other factors relevant to the phenomenon under study.
As some papers in the literature suggest, some of these other factors may be cell division and cell youth (<em>i.e.</em>, how much time has passed since the last cell division at the time of exposure to a toxic agent) [x, x, x].
Therefore, we chose to observe these two metrics in experiments at a purely qualitative level, i.e., without the inclusion of, e.g., metrics of membrane or cell cycle properties [x, x].</p>
<p>Although we expected to see a small contribution, either by the number of divisions or cell youth, in Figures <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-division-number-divisions-1">1.7</a> and <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-division-time-since-last-division-1">1.8</a>, we could not observe a precise effect of these variables on cell survival.
Patterns that, although they could have an explanation or biological significance, we decided to omit as relevant in the characterization of our cells.
However, we derived from this analysis a slightly simpler variable that tells us whether a cell underwent a cell division event or not.
So it gives us a more generalized picture of the contribution of division to cell survival (see Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-see-datasets-individualy-pca-plasmid-variable-contribution-1">1.14</a>).</p>

<p>In Figures <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-temporal-metric-distribution-ds-red-1">1.2</a>, <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-temporal-metric-distribution-gfp-1">1.3</a>, and <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-temporal-metric-distribution-length-1">1.4</a>, we showed how, at the time of filamentation, DS-Red and GFP levels appeared indifferent to the cells.
Therefore, we hypothesized that a possible variable that could determine cell survival could be its time to activate its anti-stress response system that causes filamentation.
Furthermore, we also guided our hypothesis by previous reports showing us how the gene expression level can induce filamentation with tight temporal coordination [x].</p>
<p>While, for our analyses, we did not measure the concentration of antibiotic that triggers filamentation per se, we indirectly quantified its effect by using the time it took for a cell to reach a length at which it is already considered a filamentating cell.
Furthermore, to recognize that the observed effect was a product of the experiment, we decided to keep only filamented cells just once antibiotic exposure began.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-time-to-filamentation-filamented-once-experiment-start-1">1.9</a> shows how filamentation times are much narrower for chromosome cells than for plasmid cells.
Then, we hypothesize that the effect could come from the heterogeneity in the plasmid copy number in the population.
Also, interestingly, we observed that, for both experiments, the cells that survived had longer filamentation times than the cells that died.
These differences in response times could tell us about two main things: 1) if the cell grows too fast, it will reach a limit and start to accumulate antibiotics constantly, and 2) if the cell grows too fast, it is likely that the cost of maintaining an ample length for prolonged periods of exposure will become counterproductive.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-time-to-filamentation-include-time-to-filamentation-in-initial-exploration-initial-values-1">1.10</a>, we decided to project the results of Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-time-to-filamentation-filamented-once-experiment-start-1">1.9</a> in a space similar to the one described in Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-focus-just-in-initial-values-1">1.5</a>.
Thus, we separated our data into those cells that survived and those that did not and painted them when it took them to reach their filamented state.
With that fact, we realized that, indeed, by adding this temporal component to the initial variables of length and GFP, we could separate surviving cells from dead cells to a greater degree.
However, it may still not be enough, and there are still many other variables that play a crucial role in understanding the ecology of stress and how some cells will be survivors or not.</p>

<p>In the experiments, we observed the importance of GFP filamentation and variability for cell survival.
Similarly, we realized that other variables must be affecting the final results.
Filamentation and GFP variability alone did not fully recapitulate the expected behavior of the data.
That is, the target variables did not capture the heterogeneity of the system.</p>
<p>The inability to reproduce cell sorting led us to question two things: 1) the possibility that our sorting was wrong beforehand and 2) we did not have enough variables to capture the study phenomenon.
We decided to take the unsupervised learning way to answer these subjects because it allows us to project our data without a priori knowledge [x].</p>
<p>We opted for the path of dimensionality reduction techniques where each variable or feature is equivalent to one dimension.
The essence of dimensionality reduction is that it is not feasible to analyze each dimension with many dimensions.
Furthermore, dimensionality reduction helps us counteract several problems such as reducing the complexity of a model, reducing the possibility of overfitting a model, removing all correlated variables, and, of course, visualizing our data in a two- or three-dimensional space for better appreciation [x].
Improved visualization and identification of essential variables are the main reasons to guide and complement our research with this technique.</p>

<p>The first dimensionality reduction technique we decided to use was Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [x].
Scientist mainly uses PCA to create predictive models or in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-see-datasets-individualy-pca-chromosome-points-in-new-coordinates-1">1.11</a> separates the manually annotated classes, surviving cells separated from non-surviving cells.
However, for Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-see-datasets-individualy-pca-plasmid-points-in-new-coordinates-1">1.13</a>, the class separation was a bit rougher but allowed us to separate the surviving filament cells from the dead ones.</p>

Finding that, indeed, filamentation plays a crucial role in determining cell survival.
For example, for PC2, we appreciated how the variable end DS-Red directed the dots to the positive side, while the variable end and start length directed the dots to the opposing side.
Theresfore, we can support that filamentation has a role in moving cells away from having higher amounts of DS-Red.</p>

<p>Staying with only a one-dimensionality reduction technique was not an option, so we used the UMAP technique [x].
We mainly decided to use UMAP for clustering purposes and see if the annotated clusters corresponded to the manually annotated ones.
UMAP has certain advantages for these purposes, e.g., it preserves the global structure across the whole space, so the distances between clusters matter.</p>
<p>In Figures <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-see-datasets-individualy-umap-chromosome-points-in-new-coordinates-1">1.15</a> and <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:3-see-datasets-individualy-umap-plasmid-points-in-new-coordinates-1">1.16</a>, we show how, using the same variables used in the “PCA” section, UMAP was able to cluster the four proposed classes correctly.
Interestingly, in Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-see-datasets-individualy-umap-chromosome-points-in-new-coordinates-1">1.15</a>, UMAP formed three general groups and four for Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:3-see-datasets-individualy-umap-plasmid-points-in-new-coordinates-1">1.16</a>.
However, in general, UMAP clustered the surviving cells from those that did not make it.
On investigating why this separation occurred, we found that the large groups coalesced into one another if we eliminated the division variable.
So, in a way, the division also has a role in determining survival, but it is not essential or at least not over-represented in our data.</p>

<p>From the full tracking dataset, we decided to show how the different cell states behaved over time—for example, understanding how the cells concentrated antibiotics inside or how they increased in length for each instant.
In contrast to the dataset generated in the <a href="experiment-analysis.html#cell-length-and-the-amount-of-gfp-are-crucial-in-determining-cell-survival">1.3.1</a> section, we did not truncate the results 10 minutes after the antibiotic exposure.
In this way, we were able to observe cell behavior before and after the presence of the toxic agent.</p>

<p>In Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:04-cell-status-over-time-status-with-dead-1">1.17</a>, we observed a small fraction of cells that were already filamentous without exposure to the toxic agent in both cell strains.
However, after the onset of antibiotic exposure at minute 60, we observed increases in the proportion of filamented cells.
It is interesting to note how filament cells grew after antibiotic exposure for the chromosomal strain.
We believe that this post-antibiotic growth exists because, once the SOS system that triggers filamentation is activated, the system continues to grow until it reaches a limit regardless of whether the damaging agent is still present or not.
Moreover, we observed how the cells start to divide again after some time because the proportion of non-filament cells starts to grow while the filament cells start to divide.
We observed the same effects for the plasmid strain.
However, by experimental design, the number of filament cells expected was much lower.</p>

<p>In Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:04-metrics-over-time-1">1.18</a>, we showed how once antibiotics exposure began, those cells that died had a much faster increase in DS-Red than those that did manage to live, regardless of whether they filamented or not.
On the other hand, the surviving cells managed to maintain their DS-Red levels relatively stable.
We noted that length was critical for the surviving cells for the chromosomal strain by turning to the GFP and length variables for a temporal explanation.
Even cells categorized as non-filamented reached the filamentation threshold minutes after antibiotic exposure.
However, the distinction of live or dead filamented cells was not as evident as expected.
As for cells with plasmids, the effect on GFP for surviving cells was maintained for filamented cells and decreased for non-filamented cells.
For the filament cells that died, we showed that they had, on average, a much longer initial length than the surviving cells, so we also consider it as a necessary factor in understanding which variables affect cell survival.</p>

Figure 1.18: <strong>Population measurements over time.</strong> The colored lines symbolize the average value of each metric at each instant of time, while its surrounded gray shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval. The vertical lines represent the start and end of antibiotic exposure. The horizontal line in the length metric symbolizes the threshold to consider a cell filament. We observed a faster increase of DS-red for the non-surviving populations in both experiments. Regarding the GFP metric, the behavior is relatively stable for the chromosomal strain. In contrast, for the plasmid strain, a decline in GFP is observed for the population that did not survive. For the length metric, it is interesting to note how the chromosome cells that did not filament continued to grow past the filamentation threshold once the exposure to the antibiotic in the chromosomal strain had ended.

<p>We are confident that filamentation has a fundamental role in determining cell survival, with what we have shown so far.
However, for plasmid cells, we have a component that is of our complete interest; heterogeneity.
Each cell can possess a different plasmids number; thus, each could show a different behavior under stress [x, x].
For example, heterogeneity can produce resistant cells that do not suffer damage, susceptible cells, and cells that form filaments to mitigate environmental stress.</p>
<p>To understand the variability in plasmid copy number in the population, we decided to group cells by the proportion of initial GFP regarding the population maximum.
Furthermore, we defined 100% of the population as the number of total cells at the onset of antibiotic exposure.
Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:04-cell-status-over-time-proportion-living-cells-by-gfp-row-1">1.19</a> shows how the cells with the highest amount of GFP remained unchanged once antibiotic exposure began, while the rest of the cells started to decrease their percentage of surviving cells.
However, the decrease was not linear.
On the contrary, we observed a normal distribution in terms of the reduction of live cells.
An average GFP point provided higher survival than a point below or above the average (except for cells very close to the population maximum).</p>

<p>Therefore, what we observed was a bimodal distribution for GFP-dependent cell survival.
In order to show this effect more clearly, in Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:04-gfp-survival-probability-1">1.20</a>, we plotted the survival probability for each GFP bin without normalizing for the population maximum.
This new plot allowed us to observe how the bimodal survival distribution occurs for cells that did not grow as filaments, whereas cells that filament increase their survival probability gradually as they have more initial GFP (see also Figure <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ref" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>ref?</strong></a>)</span>(fig:03-temporal-metric-distribution-gfp-1).</p>

<p>As in Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:04-gfp-survival-probability-1">1.20</a>, in Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:04-length-survival-probability-1">1.21</a>, we show the survival probability given an initial length.
We observe that survival is higher for cells that did not grow as filament if the initial length was less than the average.
In contrast, for filamented cells, the probability of survival increased as cells length was longer at the beginning of the experiment (see also Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-temporal-metric-distribution-length-1">1.4</a>).
However, it is noteworthy that the probability of survival had a limit in which a higher initial length meant a lower probability of survival (see red dotted lines in Figure <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:04-length-survival-probability-1">1.21</a>).</p>
