<p>The processing of the raw data consisted mainly of creating two levels of observation for the cells of both chromosomal strains and multicopy plasmids.
The first level is at a cell granularity, that is, point properties.
The second level consists of the cells over time, thus observing properties at the population level.
We did this because it would allow us to understand what factors are affecting filamentation and why.</p>
<p>We decided to normalize the fluorescence values of DS-Red and GFP for both experiments based on the values observed before the start of the experiment.
It allowed us to have a basis to work with and compare the expressions between cells.
In the case of DS-Red, we also applied a logarithmic transformation to observe subtle changes that would allow us to dig deeper.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we decided to classify cells into four fundamental groups based on whether the cell was filamented and survived (see <a href="experiment-analysis.html#fig:03-cells-distribution-across-experiments">1.1</a>).
We define a <em>filamented cell</em> as a cell that is more than two standard deviations from the mean concerning the lengths observed before antibiotic entry into the system [].
On the other hand, although there are multiple ways to define death in a cell context [], we decided to consider a <em>cell dead or missing</em> when we stopped having information about it, either because of its fluorescence levels or because it left the field of experimental tracking.
Therefore, a <em>surviving cell</em> is one that existed before and after the exposure to the antibiotic.</p>

Asterisks in a line indicate whether or not there is a significant difference in the survival of non-filamented cells. The black dots represent the mean of each group, and the lines that join them are a comparative guide. The extent of the black bars represents the distribution of the data. Although, at the initial time, we observe multiple significant differences, this is likely due to the intrinsic noise of the system since, as expected, the values ​​are close to zero. We observed a difference between the surviving and non-filamented cells for the chromosomal strain for the SOS time, but the same did not occur for the plasmid strain. The final amount of DS-red makes a clear difference between survival and death.
