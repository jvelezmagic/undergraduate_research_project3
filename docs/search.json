Therefore, expected global effect population’s response times based amount antitoxin asynchronous, local level, synchronous. Consequently, different proportions presented cellular states since cells activate filamentation system others later.\nConsidering toxin-antitoxin system’s variability can modify proportions final cell states, question arose heterogeneity levels’ global behavior. answer question, evaluate probability survival population, defined distribution antitoxin levels. way, characterized population survival probability function three essential points according effect: negative, invariant, positive (see Figure 2.5). Furthermore, points relative homogeneous population’s death time question (\\(\\tau_{kill}\\)): \\(t < \\tau_{kill}\\) represent detrimental effect survival, \\(t = \\tau_{kill}\\) independent variability, \\(t > \\tau_{kill}\\) beneficial point survival. Therefore, concluded effect heterogeneity toxin-antitoxin system represents double-edged sword.\nFigure 2.5: Effect variability toxin-antitoxin system. color heatmap representative fraction living cells exposure time. white vertical line represents death time homogeneous population (\\(\\tau_{kill}\\)). \\(t < \\tau_{kill}\\), shown fraction survivors decreases variability population increases. \\(t = \\tau_{kill}\\), variability affect fraction survivors, represents percentage improvement homogeneous population. Finally, \\(t > \\tau_{kill}\\), heterogeneity population favors survival.\n","code":""},{"path":"filamentation-abstraction.html","id":"discussion-1","chapter":"2 Models to the rescue; filamentation abstraction","heading":"2.4 Discussion","text":"Today, advancements number techniques allowed extend quantitative analyses individual cells’ dynamic observations (Campos et al. 2014; Meldrum 2005; Sliusarenko et al. 2011; Taheri-Araghi et al. 2017; Ursell et al. 2017).
